ok so it's ye olde design doc

main elements of game: its dispatch but with mechs. Best way to put it.
FTL art style, simple static images of big machinery with people.

## Mechs
core part of game: must be retrofitted, upgraded, and built from the ground up. Main elements are them having a torso, legs, two arms, potentially two shoulder slots, and a head. Though, that's just most of the mechs I've seen: might be simpler to structure each part to have it's own possible ports to other parts.

Mech parts
- each part is able to connect to however many other parts: for a torso for example, there are 4 ports: head port, legs port, arm1 port, and arm2 port. This is just chest specific, and there are some torsos that may only have 1 arm, no head, no legs, etc.

Store
- parts are bought at the store, where they take time to be delivered to the garage.
- parts cost money, and must be installed by mechanics which takes a certain amount of time.
- certain parts require certain skill levels to install in mechanics.


## Missions
other core part of game: once you've built your mechs, send them on missions! Different missions have different difficulties, goals, premises, etc. Some are construction based, some are combat based, so they relate to different builds. For example, it could be that some missions must be done covertly, so no missiles are allowed. This would neuter the big missile mech you made, and cause you to think outside the box.

Missions provide money in the world, and in the grand strategy aspect of my design process could be use to gain footholds in different locations, though that's a more grand proposition that can be discarded for the sake of simplicity.


## Personnel
the final core part of the game: mechs need to be built, and run, by humans. Humans cost money. This game could be a commentary on the development and prevalence of AI if it makes it cheaper to replace your human workers with AI programs, though I feel like that's sort of cheap and has been done before. Food for thought though.
Different personnel with higher skill levels may cost more than other ones, and there could be some interpersonal drama. There's a cool python plugin called Neighborly (? im pretty sure), that simulates different social events being triggered between different people. Could be a fun addition to the game: you'd want to send your two best pilots out together, but they hate each other, so it makes it more dangerous. Or, two pilots are dating, and they have to go out with each other. You could implement rules as the boss on whether or not you get to socialize/date out of work; again, for the sake of simplicity, this should be cut.


Finally, the other main aspect is mech damage. Damage should cost money, time, and labor to repair, always. That should be the main thing you weigh: every time you send a mech on a mission, they get damaged and use fuel. Fuel must be repurchased, and damages may be mitigated if they are higher skill, but those are always the costs. Then, it becomes how often will you use your mechs before you bring them back in to get repaired: you get more money keeping them on missions, but it gets more dangerous, and you risk losing the mech.


Mechs must be able to be lost/destroyed. Doesn't cost money, you just can't use it anymore, and need to use your other mechs.

Must be able to buy mechs. 

Main maintenance costs are fuel/ammo/repairs.

That's pretty much it.


## Screens
Missions are selected in a map select screen with different mission options; mechs are repaired in your garage which is where you see each mech bay; you can click on a specific one to get an up close view of an individual mech/pilots. There's a store, where you can buy new parts and hire new personnel. Those are the main screens.

- Map for mission select
    - Individual mission select
    Description of mission, danger level, potential combatants, main goals, rewards, display image, etc.
- Garage
    - Individual mech select
    - Individual pilot select
- Store
    - Individual part select
    - Individual pilot select
- Codex
    - List of all different mechs, lore, enemies, etc.
    - Most games have this
- Settings
    - I don't know what settings would be needed but yeah, always good to have
        Always volume



Then of course, sound effects, art, etc.
